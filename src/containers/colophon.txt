h1. Because you're already well over the "Dunbar number(the suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships: roughly 150)":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number.

Starting at a new company can be hard. There are so many new faces, names, and warm bodies floating around that it can sometimes be hard to keep track of who's who.

You have enough on your plate already. You don't need to suffer from "introduction amnesia awkwardness":https://xkcd.com/302/ on top of that.

*Acquainted* makes it easy to learn the names and faces of the people you work around.

p(type). F.A.Q.

h3. Do you not care enough about me to have the common decency to learn my name?

_Nope!_ Just kidding. Rest assured, you are highly valued as an individual and a team member, but we can get overwhelmed with too much new information, and sometimes it takes time in order to properly absorb what we need to know.

h3. I have an idea for how to make Acquainted even better!

Great! "Fork the project on GitHub":https://github.com/gabrielmansour/acquainted, push your feature branch, and then "send a pull request":https://github.com/gabrielmansour/acquainted/pulls. Or, if you're not so tech-savvy, you can "log an issue or make a feature request":https://github.com/gabrielmansour/acquainted/issues.
